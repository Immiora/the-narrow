### Imiz

Goddess of knowledge and academic progress. Represented as a woman with the head of a cat. The people of Magdalen value scientific, academic research and progress, which should be pursued for its own sake. Imiz values the purity of the search for the truth, and punishes Hubris. She is [Erena](Erena)’s daughter and represents the life-side of Erena. While Erena searches for the truth in people’s hearts, Imiz finds truth in intelligence and knowledge. Imiz does not like tradition, but a festival in her honour is held at midsummer. Her twin sister is [Orana](Orana)


### Representation in the city
The [Twin Churches](TwinChurches) are dedicated to worship of Imiz and her sister [Orana](Orana). [Rosalie Beaumont](Rosalie Beaumont) is a priestess at the Twin Churches, representing [Orana](Orana).
