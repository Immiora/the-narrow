### Alaion Berrogar

25 years old, heir of the lord of [the Narrow](TheNarrow).
Trained by [Gygas Barbarossa](GygasBarbarossa). Brother of [Irina Irati Irigoyen Berrogar](IrinaBerrogar) and [Elith Hexweaver](ElithHexweaver). Sone of [Saturno Berrogar](SaturnoBerrogar)

Grew up under a very close supervision by hobgoblins as they considered him a threat to his rule.
Stays at the capital Fyrcliffe.

- Born under the sign of the Unicorn, he is now 25 years of age (I suggest him being older, but less politically capable, Lotte. Is that ok? I think that could be a fun dynamic.)
- He finds it hard to keep up with his sister Irina, and is frequently intimidated by her intelligence. Sometimes he humors her in playing dragonchess, knowing she will squarely beat him.
- Is protective of young Elith, and frequently takes her out into the wilds: trekking through nature, talking to the wildlife, or just taking a dip in a local stream.
- Alaion trained under Gygas, the Master of Arms, and still frequently seeks his advice. They often spar and invent physical challenges and games for each other.
- Devoted to his Oath to Lord and Land, which he swore in a small shrine under the Fey arch, witnessed by the Master of Keys. It is Alaion’s duty to protect those beneath him, be they man or beast. 
- He is honest, and believes lies to be dishonorable.
- Politics are not his strong suit, much to the chagrin of his grandmother Irata, who considers him to be a buffoon, much like his father.
- Is fascinated by the dwarves of Undermountain.  He has taken to learning the dwarven tongue, and likes to throw dwarven expressions and idioms around.
- As the heir, he is the Keeper of the Banner. This house banner depicts the house history in great detail, albeit often shrouded in metaphor and allegory. He frequently updates it by embroidering new scenes. His page Remo carries it with him in a wicker chest strapped to his back.
- He is in love with Tenestra Dainyr, of the rival House Daynir whom we’ve been feuding with for generations.
- Alaion likes to mingle with the common folk, often at the expense of courtly matters. People say Alaion has his father’s charisma, as well as his taste for drink and song.
