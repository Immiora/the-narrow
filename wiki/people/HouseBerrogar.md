title: House Berrogar

Not the most prestigious house anymore compared to other regions nearby. Lords of [the Narrow](The Narrow). Used to be rich and wealthy before before the [hobgoblin invasion](HobgoblinInvasion). There used to be trading cities nearby back in the day. Not anymore. Moreover, hobgoblin occupation brought the house ever closer to ruin.

Family castle Emberstone Keep now stands abandoned in the Narrow. Considered to be a long-time descendents of some spirit of the land. This legitimizes our claim to rule.

Some members are politically cunning, others are honest to a fault.
