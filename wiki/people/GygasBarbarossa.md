### Early Life and Tragedy
Gygas Barbarossa was born into House Coral, a minor house in the fiefdom of the Narrow, vassals to the powerful House of Berrogar. House Coral's original symbol—a crimson red coral—stood for exploration, academic pursuits regarding the river Nefra, and its protection. His father, Cervantes, was a man of both intellect and valor, revered for his scholarly achievements and feared for his martial prowess. Cervantes's profound love for the river Nefra once symbolized a deep respect and curiosity, but over time, this admiration spiraled into sycophantic worship and obsessive fixation.
From a young age, Gygas was steeped in the lore and mystique of the river. Cervantes's devotion to Nefra became all-consuming, and his once-revered studies turned into a dangerous obsession. The river, once a source of inspiration and knowledge, began to dominate Cervantes’s thoughts and actions. The academic pursuits that had initially driven House Coral gave way to a fervent and destructive worship that alienated friends and allies.
As Cervantes’s obsession deepened, his behavior grew increasingly erratic. What had been a scholarly pursuit turned into a frenzy of rituals and sacrifices meant to appease the river goddess. This madness gradually consumed Cervantes, transforming him from a respected leader into a figure feared and shunned.

### Fall of House Coral
Cervantes’s obsession with the river Nefra led to the downfall of House Coral. His previously strategic campaigns became reckless attempts to demonstrate his devotion, resulting in catastrophic losses. As Cervantes’s behavior became more erratic, enemies of the house seized the opportunity to strike. The once-respected House Coral was reduced to a symbol of derision and weakness.
Gygas watched in helpless anguish as his father’s obsession ravaged their legacy. The house, once a beacon of learning and strength, was now a shadow of its former self. Cervantes's actions had alienated potential allies and invited enmity from former friends. The breaking point came when enemies, seizing on the vulnerability created by Cervantes’s madness, tried to force Gygas into submission, casting him into the shadows of his father’s failures.

### Reclamation of Honor
Determined not to let his father’s obsession define him, Gygas rallied the remnants of House Coral. Fueled by grief and a burning desire to reclaim their honor, he launched a fierce and unrelenting campaign against their enemies. The rivers of Oxbow ran red with the blood of those who dared challenge him. Gygas wielded his greataxe with devastating precision, embodying the primal fury and strength of a tornadic waterspout. His actions, driven by a mixture of vengeance and determination, restored the honor of his house through sheer force and unyielding will.
During this period, Gygas re-imagined the symbol of crimson red coral. No longer did it represent peaceful exploration and academic pursuits; it now stood for rivers of blood, a grim warning to all who would oppose House Coral. His rule became marked by fear and intimidation, ensuring that no one would dare challenge his authority again.

### The Hobgoblin Invasion
For a long time, the [hobgoblin invasion](HobgoblinInvasion) proved successful, and they ruled the Narrow with an iron fist. Just as Gygas had restored his house’s glory, the hobgoblin forces, under a semi-shogunate system, launched their invasion. Gygas found himself in a moral conflict; he yearned for peace after the preceding bloodshed but could not afford to surrender. In a high-stakes gamble, Gygas risked everything—his house, his life, and his bloodline. Banished from Oxbow, Gygas and his followers became a splinter guerrilla faction.
Despite their reduced status, the legend of Gygas’s supposed mythical origins kept the flame of rebellion alive. Tales of his divine heritage circulated among the few surviving members of Oxbow, maintaining hope and resistance during the harsh occupation.

### The Feeding of the Great River
The turning point came on a fateful night known as The Feeding of the Great River. Gygas and his guerrilla faction launched a surprise assault on Castle Oxbow, flooding it with blood in a dramatic display of House Coral’s vengeance. The castle’s halls ran red as Gygas led his forces to a decisive victory, expelling the hobgoblin occupiers. The semi-shogunate fled, their leadership shattered, not to be seen again for over twenty years.
This victory marked the end of the hobgoblin occupation, and House Coral’s honor was partially restored. However, the scars of the occupation remained, and the victory was bittersweet.

### Present Day
Now, with the days of bloodshed behind him, Gygas rests in his castle at Oxbow. The once-chaotic seat of House Coral has been restored to a place of peace and learning. After his wars, Gygas’s injuries—both physical and mental—began to take their toll. He sought solace in the arts, finding a new path in poetry and self-expression. His body no longer moves with the same agility and strength it once did, but his mind and spirit are now more balanced than ever, despite the scars of old.
Gygas has taken a young pupil, Alaion Berrogar, under his wing. Alaion is a young man with a sense of maturity that Gygas lacked in his youth. Recognizing Alaion’s potential, Gygas teaches him martial techniques and the arts of war, ensuring he is well-prepared for future challenges. Gygas also strives to impart the value of introspection and expression, despite his own limited experience in these areas.

### Legacy and Contention
Despite his significant contributions, Gygas's achievements and the persistent rumors of his supernatural origins remain contentious. Many fellow houses, and even some within House Berrogar, view him with suspicion or jealousy. The people, however, have not forgotten Gygas’s heroism and the tales of his deific heritage. These stories, while controversial, have kept his legend alive.
In the tranquility of his castle, Gygas Barbarossa, the once-fierce Dragon of Oxbow, has found a measure of peace. He remains a guardian and mentor, shaping the future while honoring the tumultuous past that forged him. Despite the ongoing debates about his legacy, Gygas focuses on teaching the younger generation, especially his pupil Alaion, ensuring that the values of courage, balance, and wisdom endure.
