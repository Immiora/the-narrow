### Elith the Hexweaver

Elith is the bastard child in the family of the lord of [the Narrow](TheNarrow) and sister to [Alaion Berrogar](AlaionBerrogar) and [Irina Irati Irigoyen Berrogar](IrinaBerrogar). Eighteen years old.

From an early age, Elith displayed a natural attraction to magic. Sometimes she could control it, but often wild, unpredictable effects would occur. She would conjure fire, lightning, and storms, paralyze those around her, polymorph herself, and cause sudden shifts in appearance. As she grew older, these effects intensified and became more dangerous. Out of fear of harming others, she sought seclusion, earning the nickname "the Hexweaver". 

She believed that the source of this wild, strange magic was linked to her own origins. She was uncertain why or from where she had been taken in by the Lord's family in the Narrow. The Lord's family had told Elith that she was an orphan found in the forest near the village, which had been raided by hobgoblins. The story goes that her real family was likely killed in the attack. Elith is uncertain whether this is the full story though. Somehow she suspected that [Irata Berrogar](IrataBerrogar) might be involved, given Irata's known affinity for magic, which she had passed on to her granddaughter Irina. 

Elith is driven by a deep desire to uncover her origins, hoping to discover her true identity and understand if she might better attune to her magic.

Relationships:
- Elith idolizes Irina, who is not only intelligent and magically gifted but also possesses exceptional political acumen. However, Elith also finds Irina intimidating.
- Elith shares a close relationship with Alaion. He has always treated her with immense kindness, and she believes that such kindness is often undervalued in a ruler. She might be harboring unrequited and, in any case, unacceptable feelings toward her older brother.
- Elith attempted to help Gygas find his lost father, but when she reached the location where clues were supposed to be uncovered, a wild fireball followed her concentration spell and obliterated most of the search party.
- As the youngest child in the Lord's family, she is expected to hold the title of almoner, one who attends to and donates to the homeless and poor. Having just turned 18, she awaits the commencement of her service with trepidation. The Hexweaver spending so much time around so many unfortunate innocent people seems like a disaster waiting to happen.


When Elith was nine, she ran away from home, fleeing into the woods near her house. As she ventured deeper, the forest began to change. The trees’ leaves shimmered a more vivid green, the streams flowed clearer and faster, and the air grew thick with a sparkling mist that seemed to hum with magic. In a small clearing, she saw two creatures: a harengon — a humanoid with long, twitching ears, and a large red-furred dog that blinked in and out of sight. They turned to her, not startled but curious, as if they had been waiting. Elith had unknowingly stumbled into the Feywild, her first encounter with a world of magic and fey.

Over the years, Elith often found herself slipping into the Feywild, appearing in different places and times as she wandered through nature. Bruno, the harengon, explained that the barrier between the two worlds thinned in certain spots, allowing those sensitive to it to cross over. He noticed how Elith’s struggle to control her magic eased in the Feywild, where she became more attuned to her powers. To help her, Bruno crafted a rod from the lorebark tree, allowing her to focus her magic back in her world. The rod had another unique ability: it could pierce through space, anchoring itself in mid-air, defying gravity, and bearing immense weight on command.

Naumi, the blink dog, became Elith’s loyal companion in the Feywild, often accompanying her across the boundary into her world. One day, Naumi unearthed a curious ring near the Starfall Pond and gave it to Elith. The ring, adorned with an emerald and intricate vine patterns, protected Elith from creatures trying to read her thoughts or pry into her mind. It could turn invisible at her command and would occasionally shimmer with wild colors, accompanied by a faint whisper in an unknown language, as if carrying a distant message.

A fortnight ago, Elith wandered into the Feywild, but instead of the usual forest, she plunged into a dark void, landing in a shadowy ravine. Whispers filled the air, and fear gripped her as she backed away in the darkness. A giant winged shadow loomed on the ravine walls. “The prophecy shall come to pass,” a voice intoned, “Those who harbor dark secrets shall ascend to power again. But in their triumph, they will be undone. Madness will claim them as they descend into the all-consuming babble of the night”. Suddenly, an unseen force lifted her from the ravine, and she found herself back in the forest. Naumi was there, licking her feet, as riders rushed by, shouting, “They are gone, my lord, the hobgoblins are no more!”
