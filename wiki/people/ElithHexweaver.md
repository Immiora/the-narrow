### Elith the Hexweaver

Elith is the bastard child in the family of the lord of [the Narrow](TheNarrow) and sister to [Alaion Berrogar](AlaionBerrogar) and [Irina Irati Irigoyen Berrogar](IrinaBerrogar). Eighteen years old.

From an early age, Elith displayed a natural attraction to magic. Sometimes she could control it, but often wild, unpredictable effects would occur. She would conjure fire, lightning, and storms, paralyze those around her, polymorph herself, and cause sudden shifts in appearance. As she grew older, these effects intensified and became more dangerous. Out of fear of harming others, she sought seclusion, earning the nickname "the Hexweaver". 

She believed that the source of this wild, strange magic was linked to her own origins. She was uncertain why or from where she had been taken in by the Lord's family in the Narrow. The Lord's family had told Elith that she was an orphan found in the forest near the village, which had been raided by hobgoblins. The story goes that her real family was likely killed in the attack. Elith is uncertain whether this is the full story though. Somehow she suspected that [Irata Berrogar](IrataBerrogar) might be involved, given Irata's known affinity for magic, which she had passed on to her granddaughter Irina. 

Elith is driven by a deep desire to uncover her origins, hoping to discover her true identity and understand if she might better attune to her magic.

Relationships:
- Elith idolizes Irina, who is not only intelligent and magically gifted but also possesses exceptional political acumen. However, Elith also finds Irina intimidating.
- Elith shares a close relationship with Alaion. He has always treated her with immense kindness, and she believes that such kindness is often undervalued in a ruler. She might be harboring unrequited and, in any case, unacceptable feelings toward her older brother.
- Elith attempted to help Gygas find his lost father, but when she reached the location where clues were supposed to be uncovered, a wild fireball followed her concentration spell and obliterated most of the search party.
- As the youngest child in the Lord's family, she is expected to hold the title of almoner, one who attends to and donates to the homeless and poor. Having just turned 18, she awaits the commencement of her service with trepidation. The Hexweaver spending so much time around so many unfortunate innocent people seems like a disaster waiting to happen.
