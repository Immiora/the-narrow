### Irina Irati Irigoyen Berrogar

Irina was born in the noble family of Berrogar, the eldest of two siblings. Her younger brother [Alairon Berrogar](AlaionBerrogar) is due to inherit, and although she loves him dearly, she has also always resented him for this fact, something that threatens to split her loyalties.

Irina, whose father did not spend much time with her and whose mother was always sickly before dying young, was largely raised by her Grandmother, Irata, a very wise, conniving old lady with magical powers who behind the scenes largely managed the estate for her eldest and only son, Irina's father, who, although a man of great strength and physical capabilities, is not very good at governing or politics and prefers to hunt and drink. This, combined with the fact that it was her Grandmother who taught Irina everything she knows about laws, politics and intrigue, gave Irina a strong (though not necessarily thruthful) feeling that women are generally more competent than men. Irata was more than very fond of Irina, showering her with praise and privilige that would have made her arrogant had she not been largely ignored by her own parents. 

When she turned 16, Irata gifted Irina an emerald amulet that would help her 'channel her rage', which Irina at the time did not understand, but which she treasures deeply and nearly always carries with her on a necklace around her neck. Since wearing it, her eyes seems to have taken over its colour, and when they flash, so does the amulet, ever so slightly.

However, Irata recently passed away, leaving Irina griefstricken and feeling very alone in a court where there are not many other noble people around - let alone women - with whom she has been allowed to associate much. Irina has learned to show a noble countenance and treat commoners with respect and kindness, but kep her distance. The only person she would more or less refer to as a friend is her handmaiden, a girl her own age called NAME. 

At least Grandmother did leave her with her companion, a fiery red pseudo-dragon called Iskierka who can breathe just a tiny bit of fire and is always ready for a fight. Irina feels more lonely than ever at court and is also scared for what the future holds. How solid is their House without Grandmother leading, her father incompetent and her brother still so very young? There are already signs that their House's enemies have sniffed out new possibilities with the great but feared Irata out of the way.

Meanwhile, another concern is that having reached the age of 21, Irina is starting to fear that her father may want to marry her off - and although she understands her duty in marrying well and in no ways is set upon marrying for love, hopes against all hopes that it won't simply be to the highest bidder. 

Irina is not the easiest of persons to be around; though she is trying to be loyal to her family, she also feels a rage that she cannot easily keep under control, and tends to outwardly at least show a slightly haughty countenance. Luckily, Grandmother has instilled in her the importance of controlling her true feelings and using her words wisely.
