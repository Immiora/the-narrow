### the Narrow


300-400 years ago it was a more strategic place, when there were a couple capital city states were nearby. These cities are in ruin now. One of them is repurposed as the hobgoblin capital Hob.

Human society lives with the notion that people live on borrowed time. People expect that [Nephra](Nephra) might flood at any moment. 

People think that places have power. Abstract entities can be personified: Nephra, for example. People can meet a person who would be embodying a mountain or another natural entity. 


#### History of the region
Avalrona, Qishu, Tresse were the human big cities back in the day. The flooding incident destroyed them hundreds of years ago. Hob is built on the ruins of Tress. A lot of present-day noble familities stem from old families that moved from there to the North. Dainyrs were one of them - refuges of those city states. We were the original locals of these lands. This was our prestigue card.
