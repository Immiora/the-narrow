### Session 1
Gygas
Alaion
Irina
Elith

#### Prologue
Elith in the woods, lost. Twilight. Sees a head on a spike. Called herself "granny". The head said: 

*"Ha! You smell familiar. Come and let me look at you. Oh yes, such dreams as you have. It will happen. The prophecy shall come to pass. He lies sleeping still, and Nephra flows south ever more. Ever winter. We need a springtide, and the later it comes, the worse it will be. But we won't be seeing winter anytime soon. Justice, they call it, or revenge, but all is fair in love and war, don't they say? Now shoo, go away. Let me rest on my poor stake in peace."*

#### Day 1
We are at Fircliff (small: 1,000 people live there). 

It is fall. October. 
We are now preparing to head to Embercliff keep (a few hours away): our family old fortress. Since hobgoblins are gone now.
Raven is carrying a message.
Irina is worries she would be left behind. Talking to her grandmother. She said traps are likely to be left behind, even a few
Irata said that Irina should go see General Grax, ambitious guy, open to cruelty. You cannot trust Saturno to see Grax. Irina will go alone. Dad has the letter that arrived today, Irata says that Irina should read what's in it. Irina wants to see the general first. Pseudodragon hates hobgoblins. Smoke comes out of her nose. 

Gygas is reading about predition, deities + mythology at home in his library. Preparing to leave for Fircliff. Reading about Nethra. Looking for any correlations between mythology, history, prophecies and presetn day events. Nethra is a river and a goddess of love: trecherous. Accounts of his father: never had the time to read. Sometimes Nethra would flow in the opposite direction: people from 200 years old would be accustomed to it. To us it is unusual. Bodyguard Leon notifies that it is time to leave.

Alaion ia qith his squire Remo. They are at the market getting weaving supplied to work on the tapestry of the family: updating the reclaiming of the ansestry seat. Wants to use the golden thread. Likes to haggle and interact with the common folk. Genuine article: subterranian silk - one of the sources of riches of the region. Father asking after Alaion. Father is impatient and frustrated. Father says: "Something has come up. I have to go to court in Magdalen. Need to leave now. It may be about the mother, some political reason." Alaion will lead the mission to the keep in his name. 

Elith is by the Leap. A small appears by the river (common), riders moving to Oxbow: fathers banners. Elith heads back to their castle to see what is up.

Irina is reading the letter from the mother the father got. Child Tobin is missing, somehow documents with our seal are involved. Some political intrigue. Beirok is Irina's handmaiden. Irina is off to the encampment. Talking to Grax. Drink together. Trying to figure out the traps that hobgoblins left behind at the Keep: entryway arrows, traps in the bridge, some vats of acid etc. They are getting plans for the Keep. Grax has been willing to cooperate with us for no reason. He is sharing information about the traps. He is also hiding some traps though (by greenhouses), but Irina notices them. They want to keeo others off the Keep, as it is in a strategic position - therefore the traps. 

All unite before heading out toward the keep. Gygas: it is expected that hobgoblins would protect the Keep before leaving.

Early afternoon. 

Our father was quite vocal about this transition of power going peacefully. Going over the Leap freaks people out. We can take the boat to go under it to reach the Keep.

Flat bottom ship going past the docks. Taking down the sail. People are using this ship up North (trade: silk skimmer). The line the ship is following is off, skirting close to the southern bank of the river. One person on board, captain. He if fixing things, placing the tiller. A small boy is on board. We sent off a crew to intercept.

Dainyr woman in the letter - the woman at Suncrest (Helena Dainyr), ruling house in the fifdom next to us. Rivalry with them, going back for generations. Our house was founded here, we are very local. At some point our family influence spread out. The Dainyr family was a big political player in a big city state before the big Flood that destroyed it. They took some of our land through conquest and intrigue. 

We are intercepting the boat. The boy looks confused. The captain jumps into the water. Smell of sulfar on ship: loaded with explosives.

As the ship crashed, the arch collapsed. The arch of the Leap was destroyed and a cave opened up on the other side. The Keep stayed in place.


### Session 2
The Leap is gone. A giant cave mouth is open on the other side of the river. Guygas and boy are hanging on the immovable rod. Water level is rising because of the dam. We are all in the skiff together with the captain who is bleeding prdofusely. Alaion heals him. More water is flowing South, partially blocked by the new dam - as the result of the explosion. 

Boy with a dot of black hair, dusky dark skin, between 5 and 10. Heir apparent of the Lord's house. Does not remember how he got on the ship. Chased the cat, jumped over the wall and found himself on the other side of the wall.

We sent people to work on the dam. Now that it collapsed, the scouts are trapped as well.
Gugas, Irina and Alaion are going to Irata to question the boy. Elith is going to the site of the collapse to figure out what happened to the Leap and whether she could still reach ShadowFey.

Bairok is watching Tobbin. The rest is talking to grandmother. 

Elith sees the damage by the arch, where the Leap used to be. Small familiar footpath is gone. Elith manages to get through the rubble over the Leap.

Bruno in a treehouse. Something is wrong. Bruno is roughed up, limbs are broken. Huts and people are around. Southern Courts is through the cave: part of ShadowFey. Hobgoblins are near the cave. Naumi is investigating the cave.

Irata saw the explosion, they told her about Tobbin. 

Irata: things have been going suspiciously well for us lately: hobgoblins retreat, trade and crop improving, our political standing is improving. Irina: house of Dainyr is setting this up. Father took 12 guard when he left. Alaion and Irina disagree about what to do: whether it is okay to keep Tobbin or not.

Gygas is interrogating the captain. Wants to tell us why he took the boy but cannot tell us. He pushed the boy out of his own will. Gygas goes through the captain's belongings: ship's manifest, rapier, dagger, purse with silver, document that carries our seal. John Tappisher is his name. Black firepowder: used in the mines of North, cant tell us how he got it. Magic does not wear off. All is fair in love and war.

Dainyrs are from South Downs: North-West from us. Everything north-west of Magdalen is considered North mines.

On the other side of the dam people are coming in to observe the damage. Scouts are trying to scale the dam, getting over. Naumi comes back. Five hobgoblins. She will keep an eye on them. Hobgoblins are going deeper in the cave.

Old man Willow: latest gossip about Willow and his offsprings. Sharing some tea (Magdalen Skirmige) with him. He will tell the Bee Keeper (her) that I am interested in people to help with the dam. Nails (hobgoblin, fisherman), Laurian (girl my age) tied to the Mirror Lake - keen to help with the dam.

The seal on the document is a convincing copy of our signet. Forgery. Irina opened the letter, a tiny crack appears on the seal. The letter is an empty sheet. Ring-sized seal. 

We have a spy among Dainyrs, in Suncrest. Dainyrs are antagonistic towards Gygas as well us Berrogar. 

Irina sent a letter to father with a warning that he may be walking into a trap, sent by courier. Alaion is sending a letter to his love interest among Dainyr telling her everything including that we found Tobbin and have him currently. He speaks to the dove (Speckled Jim): do not let the letter fall into the wrong hands. Elith is using this time to recruit people in the forest to help with the dam. 

World is quite fragmented in general. May be wise to tell about the incident only to select people. Hobgoblins are known for their engineering skills. 

Scouts returned to Fyrcliff. Hobgoblins were stationed at the camp (about 200 men in total), went to investigate the explosion, entered the cave. Those were scouts. Grax's soldiers. Most of the castle is empty. Southern hall is inhabitted by a giant of a man (twice the human size). Rare kind of a creature. Scouts did not check the bridge. Some traps were already disarmed. The giant is hearding goats there. The keep is in disrepair. Lower part of the keep are accessible. Keep is accessible by skiff.

Elith goes to the body. She gets an inkling about the kind of magic: someone or something made this person promise.

Irina went to general Grax at the encampment. Asking about an engineer to help break the dam. More testing is needed to estimate the time for this work. Grax feels strongly for this land, feels that the land needs to be protected. Sees us as stewards of the land. Irina feels insulted. 

### Session 3
Speckled Jim came back.

> My Dearest Alaion,
> Your letter reached me just as the sun began to dip below the hills, its golden light reminding me of your warmth. I read your words again and again, the weight of your secret pressing on my heart like a stone. The missing Duke’s heir... I can scarcely believe it, yet I know you would not entrust me with this if it were not true. You’ve placed your faith in me, and I swear on all that we share, I will guard this knowledge with my life. It is a heavy burden, but one I carry gladly, for your sake.
> Yet, even as I hold your secret close, my heart is torn. There is something you must know, something I never wanted to confess, but I cannot keep it from you any longer. My family—gods, it pains me to even write this—has sent a force to the border. Their intent is to intercept your father, to arrest him before he can reach Magdalen. I fear the worst, Alaion. I fear that my house seeks to use this moment to fracture yours, and it terrifies me that I cannot stop them.
> You must understand, my love, I had no part in this. My loyalty is yours, as is my heart. Every piece of me belongs to you. I feel so helpless, caught between blood and love, between duty and desire. But if it comes to choosing sides, know this: I will always stand with you.
> I am begging you—prepare your father. Find a way to warn him before it is too late. If we move quickly, perhaps we can stop this before it becomes something far worse. I don’t want you to bear the consequences of a war neither of us wants. I couldn’t bear to lose you.
> Please, stay safe, Alaion. I long to be at your side, to tell you all of this in person, to feel your arms around me as we face this storm together. Soon, I hope.
> Yours, now and always,
> Tenestra


Elith also received a letter.

> Letter from the Beekeeper to Elith 
> To my little caterpillar,
> The bees have whispered to me of your request, flitting between petals and secrets. I am inclined to aid you in your endeavors, but all things must be balanced.
> In return for my help, you must fetch me something that I’ve long sought: the Moonlit Comb. It belonged once to a noble of the northern courts in the Margraeve, a shimmering charm hidden from mortal eyes. It holds more than simple beauty, little caterpillar, for its powers would serve me well in tending the hives and weaving the delicate threads of what lies beneath.
> Until the comb is in my hands, we are bound in this dance of favor. Now go, and remember: even the smallest creatures can shape the course of kings.
> --The Beekeeper

In Margraeve woods (north of the river) or Margraeve fiefdom (between here and Madgalen).

Our father was intercepted by a large force of 30 armed Danyer men. Likely taken to Suncrest castle.

We all meet up downstairs.
