### Hobgoblin Invasion

Grandfather of the [House Berrogar](HouseBerrogar) was killed in the invasion. The invasion took place 25 years ago. The young lord was fostered somewhere else. He came back to [the Narrow](TheNarrow) after the invasion. Irata was in the Narrow and survived the invasion. 

During the hobgoblin occupation, the young lord was either under the house arrest or was away. His children grew up without him being close. A standing army of hobgoblins. Military dictatorship, rulling quite a lot day to day.

Gorrila warfare during occupation led by [Gygas Barbarossa](GygasBarbarossa) in Oxbow.

Now the hobgoblins are suddenly retreating.
