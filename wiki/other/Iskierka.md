### Iskierka, pseudodragon

Iskierka’s egg somehow fell into the hands of an ancestor of [Irata Berrogar](IrataBerrogar). However, it never hatched and was long lost until Irata found it in a hidden corner of the castle. Irata had the good sense of placing the egg in the fire of her own chambers, and after what for Irata was a particularly hot winter, the egg started shaking and rumbling and out burst Iskierka, scattering but of eggshell and slime everywhere, and already fiercely red and coughing up bursts of smoke and fire.

Irata kept Iskierka in her bedroom for the first months in order to protect the newborn hatchling, and the little dragon bonded strongly to Irata. They would have long conversations and Iskierka started to feel as protective towards Irata as that lady towards her (at some point, when Irata told her the story of the Hobgoblins who were according to her intelligence making ready for an invasion, Iskierka started flapping wildly about the bedchamber in circles, screaming ‘Burn them! Burn them all!’ while using her little bursts of fire to scorch the walls of the room, which were, luckily, made of stone). 

Iskierka never grew much bigger than a very small greyhound, but fierce she is. She turned out red – bright red flowing into more crimson colours – with a single green stripe on her back and some green spots on her head. Before being taken out into the world beyond the bedchamber, Irata taught her to control her bursts of fire (one time, when Iskierka suffered a minor cold, she had to sleep next to the fireplace, where some poor nervous servants would be standing at the ready with buckets of water, just in case). Now, Iskierka’s flames are only used to light candles and torches, and, occasionally and of course fully accidentally, scorch the eyebrows of some hapless smugglers. Most servants try to keep their distance. 

Iskierka is nearly always at Irata’s side, often curled on her lap or travelling on her shoulders, her tail curled around Irata’s arm and her little claws grasping at the leather shoulder patch specifically designed for both lady’s comfort. She likes to whisper her opinions into Irata’s ear (loudly), and, when she gets excited, agitated or angry, which is a lot, claws a little at whatever is in front of her.

At night, Iskierka sleeps on her hoard of treasure in Irata’s bedroom. Being a dragon after all, she has a clear penchant for luxury – and spent her first years around the castle gathering everything shiny, including soldier’s helmets, many a copper cup, small glimmering items, and, on one occasion, a rather large adorned mirror set with precious gems which had once belonged to Irata’s great-great-grandmother. Merchants often bring Iskierka coins, small trinkets or even jewelry or precious stones to win her favour, and therefore Irata’s. 

Iskierka still harbours great resentment towards hobgoblins, and a trail of smoke often comes from her nostrils when one is near. In order to keep the peace, Iskierka is occasionally escorted outside by Irata’s personal guards and brought to a small, long abandoned stone house outside of the city’s limits, which she has been told belongs to a Hobgoblin general, and which she will gleefully circle and scorch (‘Burn them! I say burn these vile creatures! Burn them all’).

Iskierka follows Irata’s advice in whom to like and whom not. She likes [Irina Berrogar](IrinaBerrogar) and sometimes joins her when she goes horse riding, practice bow and arrow shooting, or visit the citizens and villagers loyal to the House.
